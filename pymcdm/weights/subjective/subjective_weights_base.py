    """
    A base class for subjective weighting methods that do not rely on pairwise comparison matrices.

    This abstract base class provides a common interface for subjective weight determination methods
    such as SWARA, FUCOM, BWM, PIPRECIA, SIMOS, LBWA, and others. Subclasses must implement the
    `_calculate_weights` method which contains the specific algorithm logic.

    The weights are computed lazily on first call and cached for subsequent calls.
